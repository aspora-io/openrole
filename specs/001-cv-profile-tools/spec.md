## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What should be the maximum file size limit for CV uploads? ‚Üí A: 10MB
- Q: What validation criteria should be required for the "Verified Candidate" badge? ‚Üí A: Email + complete profile + ID verification
- Q: How long should candidate data be retained after last activity? ‚Üí A: 3 years
- Q: When a candidate deletes their profile, what should happen to their historical application data? ‚Üí A: Anonymize and retain for employer records
- Q: Which metrics should be included in calculating employer trust scores? ‚Üí A: Response rate + response time + feedback quality + job posting accuracy + hiring rate

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a job seeker on OpenRole.net, I want to create a comprehensive professional profile with my CV, control who can see my information, and have tools to optimize my job search, so that I can find relevant opportunities while maintaining my privacy and presenting myself in the best light to potential employers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new candidate signs up, **When** they access their profile page, **Then** they can add personal details, work experience, education, skills, and upload their CV
2. **Given** a candidate has created their profile, **When** they set privacy to "anonymous", **Then** employers cannot see their name, photo, or contact details until the candidate allows it
3. **Given** a candidate has a complete profile, **When** they apply for a job, **Then** their profile and chosen CV version are shared with the employer
4. **Given** an employer searches for candidates, **When** they filter by skills and salary range, **Then** they see matching candidate profiles respecting privacy settings
5. **Given** a candidate wants multiple CV versions, **When** they upload additional CVs, **Then** they can store and label multiple versions for different applications
6. **Given** a candidate has applied to jobs, **When** they view their application tracker, **Then** they see the current status of each application

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a candidate uploads a corrupted CV file?
- How does the system handle profiles switching between privacy levels mid-application?
- What occurs when a candidate deletes their profile with active applications?
- How does the system manage CV file size limits and format restrictions?
- What happens when salary expectations exceed all available jobs?
