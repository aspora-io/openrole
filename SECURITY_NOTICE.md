# Security Notice - Credential Rotation Required

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: MITIGATED

## Issue Summary

During a comprehensive codebase security audit, it was discovered that environment configuration files containing sensitive credentials were present in the repository filesystem (though not tracked in git history).

## Affected Credentials

The following credentials were found in filesystem files and should be considered exposed:

1. **JWT Secret** - Used for authentication token signing
2. **Google OAuth Credentials** - Client ID and Secret for OAuth integration
3. **Database Passwords** - PostgreSQL credentials

## Actions Taken

### Immediate Mitigation (Completed)

1. ✅ Verified secrets were NOT in git history
2. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future secret commits
3. ✅ Removed real credentials from `.env.example` template
4. ✅ Created proper environment variable documentation

### Required Actions (MUST BE DONE)

#### 1. Rotate JWT Secret

```bash
# Generate new JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"

# Update in production environment
# DO NOT commit to git - use environment variables
```

#### 2. Rotate Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
3. Delete existing OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
4. Create new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Update redirect URIs:
   - Production: `https://openrole.net/api/auth/google/callback`
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback`
6. Update `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in production environment

#### 3. Review and Update Database Passwords

```bash
# Update PostgreSQL password
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'new-secure-password';

# Update DATABASE_URL in production environment
export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:new-password@host:5432/openrole'
```

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Security

- Added comprehensive `.env.example` with placeholder values
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent any `.env*` files except `.env.example`
- Documented all required environment variables

### 2. Database Security

- Implemented connection pooling with configurable limits
- Added connection timeout configuration
- Created proper Drizzle ORM schema with type safety
- Removed placeholder database models

### 3. Authentication Security

- Fixed middleware exports for consistent auth implementation
- Added proper type safety for authentication context
- Implemented role-based access control patterns

## Ongoing Security Best Practices

### Never Commit Secrets

**DO NOT** commit any of these files:
- `.env`
- `.env.local`
- `.env.production`
- `.env.development`
- Any files containing API keys, passwords, or tokens

### Use Environment Variables

All sensitive configuration should be:
1. Stored in environment variables
2. Injected at deployment time
3. Never hardcoded in source code
4. Documented in `.env.example` (without real values)

### Secrets Management

For production deployments, consider using:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Azure Key Vault
- Docker secrets
- Kubernetes secrets

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] JWT secret rotated in production
- [ ] Google OAuth credentials regenerated
- [ ] Database passwords updated
- [ ] All environment variables updated in deployment platform
- [ ] Application tested with new credentials
- [ ] Old credentials confirmed non-functional
- [ ] Team notified of credential rotation
- [ ] `.env.production` deleted from local filesystems

## Timeline

- **2025-10-30 10:00 UTC**: Issue discovered during security audit
- **2025-10-30 10:30 UTC**: Verified secrets not in git history
- **2025-10-30 11:00 UTC**: Immediate mitigations applied
- **2025-10-30 11:30 UTC**: This security notice created
- **2025-10-30 EOD**: Target for credential rotation completion

## Additional Security Enhancements Needed

The following security improvements are recommended:

1. **Implement JWT Refresh Tokens** - Add refresh token rotation
2. **Add JWT Blacklisting** - Implement token revocation with Redis
3. **Enable 2FA** - Two-factor authentication for admin accounts
4. **Security Headers** - Add security headers middleware
5. **Rate Limiting** - Implement Redis-based distributed rate limiting
6. **Audit Logging** - Log all authentication and authorization events
7. **Dependency Scanning** - Add automated vulnerability scanning to CI/CD
